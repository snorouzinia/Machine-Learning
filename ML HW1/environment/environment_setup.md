# Environment Setup

1. Refer to the EdStem post about [VS Code and Anaconda Setup Guide](https://edstem.org/us/courses/101613/discussion/8244593) if you do not already have an Anaconda distribution installed (if you know what you're doing with regard to python, this TA recommends Miniconda or Miniforge; Anaconda just has a lot of overhead).
2. Create a conda environment from the .yml files provided in `/environment` folder:
    - If you are running windows, open the Anaconda Prompt, on Mac or Linux you can just use the Terminal.
    - Use the command: `conda env create -f environment/ml_hw1_env_<OS>.yml`
    - Replace `<OS>` with what's relevant to you: `[linux_64, osx_64, osx_arm64, win_64]`.
    - This should create an environment named `ml-hw1`.
3. Activate the conda environment:
    - Use the command: `conda activate ml-hw1`
    - You should see (ml-hw1) beside your cursor where (base) was before.
4. Activating the environment does not mean the environment will be used when running Python applications. In VS Code, follow these steps:
    - Open the Jupyter notebook file
    - On the top right, click the button that states "Select Kernel"
    - Select "Python Environments..."
    - Select the ml-hw1 environment
